#1 In order to run the 'predict-able' demonstration, place a copy of iq in the same folder with the other files.

#2 If your system shell at /bin/sh is bash, zsh or ksh, then skip this next step.
    Otherwise, you'll need to edit the first line (shebang) of predict.sh and predict-able.sh to have
    them be executed. The original script, predict.sh will only run under bash, zsh or ksh.
    predict-able.sh will run under all those, plus posh and dash.
    See the header of each script and change shebang as needed.
    
#3 Make the scripts executable with the command:
chmod +x *.sh
Use a wide terminal window for best viewing of output.
Execute the original script from this directory like this:
./predict.sh
You should see first, this output line followed by similar lines:
1.29044000,.69426400,.46348000,.69044000,1.19426400,.66348000,.44713200,.64713200,1.04713200            0.668188
< ----------------------- these are the values of the weights for each iteration ----------->   and this^^^^^^^^ is the probability.
The probability is highlighted and illustrates how the best guess of the algorithm gets better each time.

#4 Then execute the script using 'iq' like this:
./predict-able.sh

#5 To compare execution times, preceed the commands with 'time':
time ./predict.sh
time ./predict-able.sh
